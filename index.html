                        is an entertainment and red-light district in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. Kabuki-chō is the location of many host and hostess clubs, love hotels, shops, restaurants, and nightclubs, and is often called the "Sleepless Town" (眠らない街).

                    <div id="artAlt">
                        Originally, the area was known as <b>Tsunohazu</b> (角筈) and was a swamp. After the Meiji Period, the area became a duck sanctuary. As the Yodobashi Purification Plant was built in 1893, the ponds were filled in. In 1920, a girls' school was built there, and the surroundings were developed into a residential area. Prior to World War II, the district was one of the areas open to foreign-born property owners (primarily from Taiwan and Korea), who mainly operated tsurekomi yado, predecessors to today's love hotels.

                    <div>
                        By 1999, the area had been named "Asia's largest adult entertainment district", and tabloids were regularly running candid photographs of drunken Kabukichō patrons fighting and being arrested. However, starting in 2003, joint citizen and police patrols began enforcing business licensing, and the 1948 Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Act was more strictly enforced as well starting in April 2004, forcing adult-themed businesses to start removing customers at midnight in preparation to close by 1 AM. Kabukichō leaders attributed the change in enforcement to Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara and the Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

                        The official local ambassador, the giant Godzilla is now a permanent feature and on occasion will light up and roar, which never ceases to be entertaining. He can be spotted from afar and makes a great meeting place (way cooler than Hachiko) as he sits right in the middle of Kabukicho.
He is actually part of Gracery Hotel and you can book rooms with a view of his face, or take a tour up to the roof to see him close up!

The Toho Cinema (same building as the hotel) is also a great place to see movies either dubbed or subtitled as they have a great selection—perfect for a rainy day.

                        Pretty much the only family-friendly option for the area, the Samurai Museum has an impressive display of costumes, swords and all things samurai to enjoy, spanning 800 years of history. The museum is relatively small, but staff are knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions from visitors in English. They have demonstrations by trained actors and you can try on different costumes too. Guided tours are available and a good option, so you can have in-depth explanations to all the sections. Tickets are ¥1,800 for adults and ¥800 for children, so it’s a bit steep, but read more here and you may just find yourself convinced!

                        Built in the Edo period by the Hanazono family, this is one of the most historical Shinto shrines in Japan, but easy to miss. Find the tiny gap in tall buildings and step through the red torii gate to find a mini escape from the busy streets. Meaning “flower garden”, Hanazono was once part of the Imperial Gardens and later had a garden growing vegetables and flowers. The shrine has plenty of festivals including the popular Bird Festival held in November and the two-horse festival in February, as well as celebrating traditional ones like Setsubun and the New Year ceremonies. Once you’re done, if you fancy a drink, you can head down the path to the left of the complex and it leads you straight to Golden Gai.
